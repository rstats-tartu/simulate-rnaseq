This workflow performs differential expression analysis on simulated paired-end RNA-seq data.
Reads were simulated with `Polyester <https://github.com/alyssafrazee/polyester>`_.
Gene counts were generated with `Salmon <https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/>`_.
Integrated normalization and differential expression analysis was conducted with `DESeq2 <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html>`_ following standard procedure as outlined in the manual.
